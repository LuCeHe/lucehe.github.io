**Last updated:** February 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how ChunkUs ("we", "our", or "the app") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the ChunkUs mobile application and related services.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Account and profile data

When you create an account or use the app, we may collect:

- **Email address** (used for sign-in and account recovery)
- **Display name** (chosen by you)
- **Preferred language** (app language setting)
- **Profile photo** (optional, if you upload an avatar)
- **Gender** (optional, if you provide it)

### 1.2 Session and grouping data

When you create or join sessions (e.g. group-forming activities), we store:

- **Session details** (name, settings, parameters you choose)
- **Your role** in each session (e.g. organizer or participant)
- **Preferences** you submit (e.g. who you’d like to work with or avoid)
- **Skill ratings** (self or organizer evaluations, when the session uses skills)
- **Grouping solutions** (proposed groups and related scores)
- **Feedback** you optionally give (e.g. how well the groups worked)

This data is used to run the grouping logic and to improve the service.

### 1.3 Device and push notifications

If you allow notifications, we collect and store:

- **Push notification token** (e.g. Expo push token) so we can send you reminders (e.g. session reminders)
- **Device type** (e.g. "android" or "ios") to link the token to your account

You can turn off notifications in your device settings at any time.

### 1.4 Automatically collected data

- **Authentication state** (e.g. session tokens) so you stay signed in
- **Technical data** (e.g. app version, platform) as needed for operation and support

We do **not** use third-party advertising or analytics trackers that follow you across other apps or sites.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- **Provide the app** (account management, sessions, grouping, reminders)
- **Run grouping logic** (preferences, skills, solutions) and show you results
- **Send push notifications** (e.g. session reminders) if you have enabled them
- **Improve the service** (e.g. using anonymized or aggregated feedback to tune parameters)
- **Support you** (e.g. replying to support requests linked to your email)
- **Comply with law** (e.g. when required by law or to protect rights and safety)

We do **not** sell your personal data.

---

## 3. Legal Basis (EEA/UK)

If you are in the European Economic Area or the UK:

- **Contract:** Processing necessary to provide the app (account, sessions, grouping, notifications).
- **Consent:** Where we ask for consent (e.g. push notifications, optional profile fields).
- **Legitimate interests:** Improving the service, security, and support, where balanced against your rights.
- **Legal obligation:** Where we must process data to comply with law.

You can withdraw consent (e.g. for notifications) at any time via device settings or by contacting us.

---

## 4. Who We Share Data With

We share data only as follows:

- **Supabase:** We use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) to host our database and authentication. Your account, profile, session, and preference data are stored and processed by Supabase under their [Privacy Policy](https://supabase.com/privacy) and data processing terms.
- **Expo (push):** Push notifications are delivered via [Expo](https://expo.dev/) services. Push tokens and related technical data are processed in line with Expo’s practices and our instructions.
- **Other users in your sessions:** Other participants and organizers in a session may see information relevant to that session (e.g. that you are in a session, your preferences within that session, and grouping results), as intended by the app.
- **Legal and safety:** We may disclose data if required by law or to protect rights, safety, or property.

We do **not** sell or rent your personal data to third parties.

---

## 5. Data Retention

- **Account and profile:** Retained while your account exists. You can request deletion (see Section 7).
- **Sessions and grouping data:** Retained as long as the session exists and as needed for the service (e.g. history, improvements). Session owners may delete sessions; associated data can be removed in line with our systems.
- **Push tokens:** Retained while your account is active and you have notifications enabled; removed or updated when you disable notifications or delete your account.
- **Backups and logs:** May be kept for a limited period for security, backup, and legal compliance, then deleted.

---

## 6. Security

We use industry-standard measures to protect your data, including:

- **Encryption in transit** (e.g. HTTPS/TLS)
- **Access control** (only authorized systems and roles can access data)
- **Secure authentication** (e.g. Supabase Auth)

No system is 100% secure. We encourage you to use a strong password and to keep your login details private.

---

## 7. Your Rights

Depending on where you live, you may have the right to:

- **Access** the personal data we hold about you
- **Correct** inaccurate data
- **Delete** your data (subject to legal or contractual retention)
- **Restrict or object** to certain processing
- **Data portability** (e.g. a copy of your data in a machine-readable format)
- **Withdraw consent** where processing is based on consent
- **Lodge a complaint** with a supervisory authority (e.g. in the EEA/UK)

To exercise these rights, contact us (see Section 10). We will respond within the time required by applicable law. For account deletion, we will remove or anonymize your account and associated data where feasible; some data may remain in backups or where we must retain it by law.

---

## 8. Children

The app is not directed at children under 13 (or higher age in some jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe we have collected data from a child, please contact us and we will delete it.

---

## 9. International Transfers

Data may be stored or processed in countries other than your own (e.g. where Supabase or Expo operate). We ensure appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard contractual clauses or adequacy decisions) where required by law.

---

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version in the app or on our website and will indicate the "Last updated" date. For material changes, we may notify you in the app or by email where appropriate. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
