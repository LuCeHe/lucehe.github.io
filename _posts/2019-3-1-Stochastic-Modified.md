Two papers have brought new clarity to my understanding on deep networks.
[Stochastic modified equations and adaptive stochastic gradient algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06251.pdf)
and
[Stochastic gradient descent performs variational inference, converges to limit cycles for deep networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.11029.pdf)
and $$x + y$$.
