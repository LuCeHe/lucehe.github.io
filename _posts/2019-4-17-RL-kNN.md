title: The secret affair between Reinforcement Learning and k-Nearest Neighbours

The paper [Q-learning with Nearest Neighbors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03900.pdf) has 
an interesting idea: what happens when we fuse together Reinforcement Learning and k-Nearest Neighbours?

I personally like the mathematical analysis, where they get some very interesting non-asymptotic guarantees. 

To have a running post I'm going to go about it like mother Nature: I'll grow it organically, it feels right. The main equation they get

$T = C_0 \frac{ L_{h^*} V_{\text{max}}^3 \beta^4}{ \epsilon^3 } \text{log} ( \frac{2}{\delta} ) \text{log} ( \frac{ N_{h^*} |\mathcal{A}| V_{\text{max}}^2 \beta^4 }{ \delta \epsilon^2 } )$

How does that compare to other RL algos?
